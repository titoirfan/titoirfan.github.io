# Hello, World!

Today I decided (on a whim) that I will remake my website. I also decided to grab a domain while I'm at it, ~~considering I can also use it as a Bluesky handle~~.

<!-- more -->

My main concerns regarding my old website was that it was hard to maintain and update. I also messed around a little too much with the template I was using to make it fit my use case.

After a quick search on Github, I found [this template](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs) that allows me to publish my Obsidian notes on Github Pages. This is great for two reasons: I've been logging pretty much everything in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for the past few years, and I have virtually zero web development skills. After setting everything up, I must say that I am impressed with the template and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), both are really easy to use but powerful and customizable.

Now that my website is much simpler and maintainable, I kind of want to put my paper reading notes here. Maybe I will also write more blog posts, who knows. But I really shouldn't jump the gun, I still have to migrate all the contents from my old website to this one, oh well.

For you who have read through the whole post, I hope you have a great day!
