Past research and courseworks that I have done.

## Research

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-tram:{ .lg .middle } [[autonomous_tram.md|__Autonomous Tram__]]

    ---

    *An autonomous tram developed in cooperation with the Indonesian Railway Industry Company (PT INKA) and PT Riset Kecerdasan Buatan (PT RKB). I was in charge of the radar-based perception system and the tram's system integration.*

-   :material-camera:{ .lg .middle } [[clusterfusion.md|__Clusterfusion__]]

    ---

    *A radar-monocular camera fusion-based 3D object detector for autonomous vehicles. Achieved state-of-the-art performance among similar methods on the nuScenes detection leaderboard.*

-   :material-robot:{ .lg .middle } [[dagozilla.md|__Dagozilla__]]

    ---

    *Two generations of autonomous mobile soccer robots designed for the RoboCup Middle Size League.*

## Courseworks

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-radar:{ .lg .middle } [[scan_matching.md|__Scan Matching-based 2D Lidar Odometry__]]

    ---

    *A simple scan matching-based 2D lidar odometry Robot Operating System (ROS) node. The scan matching is solved using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, implemented in C++ using Eigen.*
