In 2018, I worked on the **Dagozilla Telepresence Robot** as one of [[dagozilla.md|Dagozilla's]] electrical engineers. The telepresence robot is designed to act as a representative of its user, who operates it remotely, wherever the user may be. The robot can stream the user's face and voice while being controlled through the internet. Its tablet height can be adjusted by the user to suit the user's needs. The user can use the robot for various purposes such as attending a meeting and checking around the environment.

The robot uses both a **Raspberry Pi 3B+** and an **STM32F446RE** microcontroller as its computing units. Its neck supports a **Xiaomi tablet** which acts as its user interface.

As an electrical engineer, I was in charge of the robot's overall electrical system. Specifically, I was responsible for designing, manufacturing, and implementing its tablet height adjustment electrical systems and control. I also implemented the robot's odometry system, I designed the PCBs and wrote the code for the sensor's data acquisition routine. Through the robot's manufacturing process, I actively participated in the robot's assembly and wiring process.
