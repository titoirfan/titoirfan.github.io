## Irfan Tito Kurniawan

Hi there!

I'm **Tito** (ティト), currently pursuing my PhD at Tohoku University's [Neuro-Robotics Lab](https://neuro.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/). My research interest lies in the field of **robot learning**, aiming to enable **legged robots** to intelligently navigate the real world. Aside from robotics and deep learning, I also have some background in computer vision.

On my free time, I like to draw illustrations, study Japanese, and play video games. I also have a [[blog]] on this website, please check it if you're interested.
